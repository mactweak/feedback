## Clipboard
Safe, powerful and fun! Sort by time in any order you like, add notes and search, preview images, and more than a dozen themes to choose!

## Always on top
Control your desktop view at all times. Either by mouse click or shortcut key operation, you can easily top or un-top windows. Even better, it supports personalized adjustments of border color and thickness to refresh your work and entertainment experience!

## Pin
Turn your desktop into a canvas instantly! Stick pictures, text and codes to your desktop, not only for easy reference, but also to beautify your space. Personalize the border color and thickness to make work and life more interesting!

## Keycast

## Auto input source
Automatically switches input method according to different programs. Saving 100 switches per day at 3 seconds each, that's 109,500 seconds, or about 30 hours, over the course of a year! Imagine what that equates to a whole extra day for you to explore, create and relax!!
